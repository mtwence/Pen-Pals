## Description

A personal journalling application that will allow users to create accounts and post journal entries to a dashboard.

## Roadmap

The concept for Heart2Heart is for an application that would allow users to send anonymous letters that other users could then anonymously respond to. Like a random pen-pal per se, where you have the ability to respond to a metaphorical "message in a bottle".

## Installation

```ruby
npm install
```

## Technologies Used

## Deployed Link

[Heart2Heart](https://heart-2-heartz.herokuapp.com/)

Currently there are some bugs in deployment that we're working through.

If you clone the repository and execute`ruby npm run develop` the server will start locally and you can utilize the site.
