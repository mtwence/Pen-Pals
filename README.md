## Description

A personal journalling application that will allow users to create accounts and post journal entries to a dashboard.

## Roadmap

The original concept for Heart2Heart was an application that would allow users to send anonymous letters out into the world. These letters would then be "dynamically" shown to other users, giving them the ability to respond in kind anonymously. Like a random pen-pal per se, where you have the ability to respond to a metaphorical "message in a bottle". The core focus would be around mental health and cultivating positive, encouraging, empathetic conversations.

## Installation

npm i
